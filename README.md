"# Break_Time" 
This is simple program that reminds you to take a break from the computer.
You enter enter how many breaks you want, and how far apart you want them (in hours only at this point), and you type in website that you would like to pop up. It can be a Youtube video of a song, or website with images of cats, whatever site you would like it to be.

This was an enhanced me of a project I was doing in class, I talk more about it on my blog post "Breat Time Project - Part 1".
